# SpellCheck
This repository contains a Python script for a spell-checking tool that utilizes a BK-tree data structure. The spell checker can be used through the command line, allowing users to input text and specify the number of suggestions for corrections. The BK-tree implementation is based on the Bloom_filter module.
